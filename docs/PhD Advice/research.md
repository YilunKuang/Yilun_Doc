## The Ph.D. Grind: A Ph.D. Student Memoir
- Be proactive in talking with professors to find research topics that are mutually interesting, and no matter what, don’t just hole up in isolation
- pitch research 
    - What’s the problem?
    - What’s my proposed solution?
    - What compelling experiments can I run to demonstrate the effectiveness of my solution?
- In the cutthroat world of academic publishing, simply being passionate about a topic is nowhere near sufficient for success; one must be well-versed in the preferences of senior colleagues in a particular subfield who are serving as paper reviewers.
